Imagine a banknote which is left on a table in a cafe. Anyone passing by can take it. Ownership in the physical world then means protecting banknotes and other physical objects from being taken or approached even by unintended parties. 

Digital banknotes are different. They can protect themselves with the help of public-key cryptography. That is, a banknote may be associated with public key of its owner. And then only owner (or owners) of a secret key corresponding to the public key are able to spend it. There is need to be tech-savvy or have discipline to store secret keys, on the other hand, it would still be easier, for many at least, than physically protecting notes or coins, especially when relocating them from one place (or one jurisdiction) to another.

Also, digital world allows for more, in particular, we can have protection by two public keys instead of just one. For example, a father can create a banknote which is protected by both father's and son's public keys, to authorize son's payments (e.g. when son is trying to spend the digital banknote in a shop, father may check the spending remotely and cosign it, or deny to do so). Even from this simple example it is clearly seen that issue of ownership in the age of digital money could be more complex than in physical world, as here we have collective ownership instead of individual. 

But digital banknotes allowing for even more. In the first place, it is possible to have even more complex signatures. For example, modern cryptography allows for threshold signatures with up to thousands of participants, which is allowing, for example, for a banknote to be controlled by (majority vote of) small town. In the second place, it is possible to mix cryptographic statements with machine-executable logic, making money ownership **programmable**. And with tokenization of real-world assets, we, similarly, have programmable property rights.

Blockchain is ideal execution environment, as its state at given moment of time (block) is fully deterministic. However, we can imagine other options, e.g. a note can refer to trusted non-blockchain environment its script will be executed against, or, in case of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), deterministic trusted environment could be provided by a central bank.

And then, with public and private programmable money of different kind, we have a question what does it mean to *own* money in this new digital world, i.e. what constitutes *ownership*.
